Engeto C# Academy: 1st project

JSON VAT Project

Task: Implement an application in C# that will print out three EU countries with the lowest and three EU countries with the highest standard VAT rate as of the available data within the EU.

Input: https://euvatrates.com/rates.json

Suggestions: Keep it clean and simple, but with a reasonable design allowing for future extendibility. Use any library of your choice, verify the program correctness.

Hint: We are looking for clean and elegant code, not for a full-fledged application. Think well about the functional requirements and edge cases. Simple console app (but well designed) is enough. Test driven approach is a big plus.
